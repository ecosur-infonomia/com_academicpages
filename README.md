Academic Pages

** A Joomla! component **

Academic Pages is a project to provide more information on Academics, Tehcnicians and others 
working at El Colegio de La Frontera Sur in San Crist√≥bal de Las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico. This
project is intended to be staged on the Joomla 2.5 installation at ECOSUR for use with the CMS
that governs published information regarding the University.

The project makes light use of the Joomla! framework, providing most functionality for users in
the form of a Single Page Application, driven by simple JSON dictionaries and Handlebars templates.

As a Joomla! component, the application is released under version 3 of the GPL.
